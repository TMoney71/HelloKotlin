# Overview
This code was me wanting to learn how to run and learn Kotlin, this was a story mode that I came 
up with. This is just to prove what I was able to learn and apply it to a situation. I had a lot of fun for the 
first 16-20 hours and this is what I learned.

# Development Environment

I used intelaj as my environment and this was the first time using it, I really enjoyed it 
and how easy it was to use.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add a print and read line to make the different choices 
* More changes like the map that I did
* I wanted to add in interfaces but I didn't get a good grasp on them so I would like to add those to the code
